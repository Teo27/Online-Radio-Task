# Online-Radio-Task

This was my task for an internship position in FirstOnlineSolutions

I am to receive a XML file that contains information about a song - title, album, genre, duration, next (time until next song). 
This file changes every second (next field) and I am to save the songs info into MySQL and update the page without reloading it - hence
the required use of AJAX and jQuery, together with PHP.
